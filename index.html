<h1>Zachary Mckinney</h1>
<h2>CIT</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Zach McKinney, I'm from Mooresville Indiana and I'm currently a freshman at IUPUI studying CIT. I want to study database within CIT as well as eventually take a double major into music technology. I am 18 years old and enjoy, collecting and playing instruments, exploring music generes and brewing coffee. I enjoy building computers as well as playing pretty much any type of video game or board game. Another hobby of mine is writing, DMing, and playing dungeons and dragons.</p>
